# [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) — MakeTime Custom Fork

Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](https://twitter.com/fat), and maintained by the [core team](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people) with the massive support and involvement of the community.

To get started, check out <http://getbootstrap.com>!

## Quick Start - MT Fork

Bootstrap uses Grunt for its CSS and JavaScript build system, and Jekyll for the written documentation. To use these systems, follow these steps:

1. [Download and install Node](https://nodejs.org/download).
2. Install the Grunt command line tools, `grunt-cli`, with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
3. Navigate to the root `/bootstrap` directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies from the included package.json file.
4. Install Ruby if you haven't already, and then Bundler with `gem install bundler`. Run `bundle` to install all of the Ruby dependencies like Jekyll and the Sass linter.

### Using Grunt

|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`grunt`        |Run `grunt` to run tests locally and compile the CSS and JavaScript into `/dist`.                                                  |
|`grunt dist`   |`grunt dist` creates the `/dist` directory with compiled files.                                                                    |
|`grunt test`   |Runs JSHint and QUnit tests headlessly in PhantomJS.                                                                               |
|`grunt docs`   |Builds and tests CSS, JavaScript, and other assets which are used when running the documentation locally via `jekyll serve`.       |
|`grunt watch`  |This is a convenience method for watching just Sass files and automatically building them whenever you save.                       |

### Local Documentation

Running and serving the documentation locally uses Jekyll. Here's how to access it.

1. The Quick Start section above installed Jekyll and Rouge already, so that's taken care of.
2. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
3. open [http://localhost:9001] in your browser.

### What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
bootstrap/
├── css/
│   ├── bootstrap.css
│   ├── bootstrap.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│   └── bootstrap.min.css.map
└── js/
    ├── bootstrap.js
    └── bootstrap.min.js
```

We provide compiled CSS and JS (`bootstrap.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`bootstrap.min.*`). CSS [source maps](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors) (`bootstrap.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools.

## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://getbootstrap.com>. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.5.x).
  - **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.
2. Install the Ruby-based syntax highlighter, [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge), with `gem install rouge`.
3. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
4. Open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### Documentation for previous releases

Documentation for v2.3.2 has been made available for the time being at <http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/> while folks transition to Bootstrap 3.

[Previous releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) and their documentation are also available for download.
